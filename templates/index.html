    Your app here!

    <!-- Create a baselayout for your page here
            - You can hand this page to chatgpt, tell it you are building
                an app using bootstrap, describe the layout you want, and let
                add the html for your layout to this part of the page
            - Focus on the base layout for this part, don't worry about any
                pop-up windows (known as modals) in your discussion with
                chatgpt, just focus on the page layout
    -->



     <!-- Place modal windows here below your base layout
            - You can tell chatgpt you are creating a bootsrrap page and
                would like to add a modal window to your page.  Then
                describe the modal window you want to add to your page
                and let chatgpt generate the html for you.  Then
                add that html to this part of the page
    -->
